I want to have more reasons to grow my awareness of how I learn.

That's why I started my learning journal.  I've been writing a learning journal for a while.  Usually just as a tool to condense, review, and further explore topics I've found challenging during the day or week.  This blog is an extension of that, and I'm hoping it might give me another chance to polish thoughts I have through the  learning process.  

Topics include but not necessarily limited to machine learning, mathematics, and web-programming.
